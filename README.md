# Introduction

This is a collection of digital image processing algorithms. Image I/O is handled by `OpenCV`, which reads `cv::Mat` data into a custom, simple image structure `Image`. All subsequent algorithms are implemented in C++. Vector and matrix transformations are performed using the `Eigen` library.
